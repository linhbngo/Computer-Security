    "#### Overview\n",
    "The goal of part 1 is for each team to successfully build a Github-based CloudLab profile that contains all software necessary for their selected security lab and test this profile by creating the instructions, template codes, and solutions for the environment variables and setuid labs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The CloudLab profile for this part is designed based on the instructions in Dr. Wenliang Du's [User Manual for the SEED VM](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu16_04_VM/Ubuntu16_04_VM_Manual.pdf). More specifically, the profile is to have the followings:\n",

    "- Is Built using 64-bit Ubuntu 18.\n",
    "- Has a public IP address. \n",
    "- Has a `root` account with password `seedubuntu`.\n",
    "- Has a `seed` account with passwd `dees`. This account has **passwordless sudo** privilege. \n",
    "- Has the following software application installed and configured:\n",
    "  - Anaconda for Python: Anaconda needs to be installed with default Python 3. A passwordless Jupyter server needs to be setup and launched by the `seed` user at start. \n",
    "  - SSH Server\n",
    "- Has the following software application installed and configured if your team is doing the buffer overflow vulnerability or return-to-libc labs:\n",
    "  - GDB-Peda: Update Ubuntu's default GDB debugger with [GDB-Peda](https://github.com/longld/peda).\n",
    "- Has the following software application installed and configured if your team is doing the web security labs:\n",
    "  - Apache HTTP Server.\n",
    "  - MySQL Server: Default admin accounts are `root` with password `seedubuntu` and `elgg_admin` with password `seedubuntu`. \n",

The email notification should list **ALL** labs starting with your **most preferred** and ending with your **least preferred** lab. Since each team will work on a separate lab, the selection of labs will be done on a first-come-first-server based on the time stamp of the email notification to the professor. \n",
