    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on buffer-overflow vulnerability\n",
    "by putting what they have learned about the vulnerability from class into action. Buffer overflow is\n",
    "defined as the condition in which a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of pre-allocated\n",
    "fixed length buffers. This vulnerability can be used by a malicious user to alter the flow control of the program,\n",
    "leading to the execution of malicious code. This vulnerability arises due to the mixing of the storage\n",
    "for data (e.g. buffers) and the storage for controls (e.g. return addresses): an overflow in the data part can\n",
    "affect the control flow of the program, because an overflow can change the return address.\n",
    "In this lab, students will be given a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability; their task is to develop\n",
    "a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and finally gain the root privilege. In addition to the attacks, students\n",
    "will be guided to walk through several protection schemes that have been implemented in the operating\n",
    "system to counter against buffer-overflow attacks. Students need to evaluate whether the schemes work or\n",
    "not and explain why. This lab covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Buffer overflow vulnerability and attack\n",
    "- Stack layout in a function invocation\n",
    "- Shellcode\n",
    "- Address randomization\n",
    "- Non-executable stack\n",

    "#### 2.1 Turning Off Countermeasures\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute the lab tasks using our pre-built Ubuntu virtual machines. Ubuntu and other Linux\n",
    "distributions have implemented several security mechanisms to make the buffer-overflow attack difficult.\n",
    "To simplify our attacks, we need to disable them first. Later on, we will enable them one by one, and see\n",
    "whether our attack can still be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Address Space Randomization**\n",
    "Ubuntu and several other Linux-based systems uses address space randomization to randomize the starting address of heap and stack. This makes guessing the exact addresses difficult; guessing addresses is one of the critical steps of buffer-overflow attacks. In this lab, we disable this feature using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The StackGuard Protection Scheme**\n",
    "The GCC compiler implements a security mechanism called StackGuard\n",
    "to prevent buffer overflows. In the presence of this protection, buffer overflow attacks will not work.\n",
    "We can disable this protection during the compilation using the `-fno-stack-protector` option. For example,\n",
    "to compile a program example.c with StackGuard disabled, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ gcc -fno-stack-protector example.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Executable Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ubuntu used to allow executable stacks, but this has now changed: the binary images of programs (and shared libraries) must declare whether they require executable stacks or not, i.e., they need to mark a field in the program header. Kernel or dynamic linker uses this marking to decide whether to make the stack of this running program executable or non-executable. This marking is done automatically by the recent versions of gcc, and by default, stacks are set to be non-executable. To change that, use the following option when compiling programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "For executable stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ gcc -z execstack -o test test.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-executable stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ gcc -z noexecstack -o test test.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuring /bin/sh (Ubuntu 16.04 VM only)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In both Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 VMs, the `/bin/sh` symbolic link points to the `/bin/dash` shell. However, the dash program in these two VMs have an important difference. The dash shell in Ubuntu 16.04 has a countermeasure that prevents itself\n",
    "from being executed in a Set-UID process. Basically, if dash detects that it is executed in a Set-UID process, it immediately changes the effective user ID to the process’s real user ID, essentially dropping the privilege. The dash program in Ubuntu 12.04 does not have this behavior. Since our victim program is a Set-UID program, and our attack relies on running `/bin/sh`, the countermeasure in `/bin/dash` makes our attack more difficult. Therefore, we will link `/bin/sh` to another shell that does not have such a countermeasure (in later tasks, we will show that with a little bit more effort, the countermeasure in /bin/dash can be easily defeated). We have installed a shell program called zsh in our Ubuntu 16.04 VM. We use the following commands to link `/bin/sh` to zsh (there is no need to do these in Ubuntu 12.04):\n",
    "\n",

For this task, you will recompile the vulnerable program, stack.c, to use GCC StackGuard, execute task 1 again, and report your observations. You may report any error messages you observe. In GCC version 4.3.3 and above, StackGuard is enabled by default. Therefore, you have to disable StackGuard using the switch mentioned before. In earlier versions, it was disabled by default. If you use a older GCC version, you may not have to disable StackGuard."
