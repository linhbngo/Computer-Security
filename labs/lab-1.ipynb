    "1 Overview\n",
    "The learning objective of this lab is for students to understand how environment variables affect program\n",
    "and system behaviors. Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way\n",
    "running processes will behave on a computer. They are used by most operating systems, since they were\n",
    "introduced to Unix in 1979. Although environment variables affect program behaviors, how they achieve\n",
    "that is not well understood by many programmers. As a result, if a program uses environment variables,\n",
    "but the programmer does not know that they are used, the program may have vulnerabilities. In this lab,\n",
    "students will understand how environment variables work, how they are propagated from parent process to\n",
    "child, and how they affect system/program behaviors. We are particularly interested in how environment\n",
    "variables affect the behavior of Set-UID programs, which are usually privileged programs.\n",
    "This lab covers the following topics. Detailed coverage of these topics can be found in Chapters 1 and 2\n",
    "of the SEED book, Computer Security: A Hands-on Approach, by Wenliang Du.\n",
    "• Environment variables\n",
    "• Set-UID programs\n",
    "• Securely invoke external programs\n",
    "• Capability leaking\n",
    "• Dynamic loader/linker\n",
    "Readings and related topics. Detailed coverage of the Set-UID mechanism and its security problems\n",
    "can be found in Chapter 1 of the SEED book, Computer Security: A Hands-on Approach, by Wenliang Du.\n",
    "Environment variables and their related attacks are covered in Chapter 2 of the book. A topic related to\n",
    "environment variables is the Shellshock attack, which was discovered in 2014. This relatively new attack is\n",
    "covered in Chapter 3, as well as in a separate SEED lab.\n",
    "Lab environment. This lab has been tested on our pre-built Ubuntu 12.04 VM and Ubuntu 16.04 VM,\n",
    "both of which can be downloaded from the SEED website.\n",
    "2 Lab Tasks\n",
    "2.1 Task 1: Manipulating Environment Variables\n",
    "In this task, we study the commands that can be used to set and unset environment variables. We are using\n",
    "Bash in the seed account. The default shell that a user uses is set in the /etc/passwd file (the last field\n",
    "of each entry). You can change this to another shell program using the command chsh (please do not do it\n",
    "for this lab). Please do the following tasks:\n",
    "SEED Labs – Environment Variable and Set-UID Program Lab 2\n",
    "• Use printenv or env command to print out the environment variables. If you are interested in\n",
    "some particular environment variables, such as PWD, you can use \"printenv PWD\" or \"env |\n",
    "grep PWD\".\n",
    "• Use export and unset to set or unset environment variables. It should be noted that these two\n",
    "commands are not seperate programs; they are two of the Bash’s internal commands (you will not be\n",
    "able to find them outside of Bash).\n",
    "2.2 Task 2: Passing Environment Variables from Parent Process to Child Process\n",
    "In this task, we study how a child process gets its environment variables from its parent. In Unix, fork()\n",
    "creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, referred to as the child, is an\n",
    "exact duplicate of the calling process, referred to as the parent; however, several things are not inherited by\n",
    "the child (please see the manual of fork() by typing the following command: man fork). In this task,\n",
    "we would like to know whether the parent’s environment variables are inherited by the child process or not.\n",
    "Step 1. Please compile and run the following program, and describe your observation. Because the output\n",
    "contains many strings, you should save the output into a file, such as using a.out > child (assuming\n",
    "that a.out is your executable file name)."
